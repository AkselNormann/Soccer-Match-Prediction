# Conclusion

The model to predict the outcomes of a soccer matches is built using a combination of FIFA statistics and engineered features. The model with the highest accuracy score on the test match dataset was the Logistic Regression model. Using the models probability of the predicted result of a game and comparing it to the implied probability given the bookies odds for that result and only betting when the models probability is greater than the bookies was the most betting lucrative strategy. This strategy was tested across matches in 2015 and returned an annual 9.42% ROI.
